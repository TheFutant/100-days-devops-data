# 100 Days of DevOps & Data

This is my personal challenge to build real-world DevOps and Data Analysis skills over 100 days.

## 🧭 Goals
- 100 days of daily, focused progress (~1 hour/day)
- Document each step with code and logs
- Cover essential tools: Linux, Bash, Python, SQL, Git, Docker, CI/CD, AWS, Pandas, etc.

## 📁 Structure
- `log.md` – Daily log of activities
- `dayXX_*.md/.py/.sh` – Daily task files (scripts, notes, code)
- `resources.md` – Optional reference notes and learning links
